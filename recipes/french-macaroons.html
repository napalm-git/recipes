          Fantabulous colored, bite-sized macaroons. Divide batter into thirds;
          color one portion pink and flavor with raspberry, another yellow with
          lemon flavoring, and the remaining pale blue with vanilla flavoring.
          Fill and make sandwich cookies with filling of choice, like peach jam
          or strawberry preserves.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>3 egg whites</li>
          <li>6 tablespoons superfine (castor) sugar</li>
          <li>1 cup almond meal</li>
          <li>1 â…“ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="steps">
          <h2>Steps:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 1</strong><br />
              Preheat the oven to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Line baking
              sheets with parchment paper or a silicone mat.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Step 2</strong><br />
              Whisk egg whites in a clean metal mixing bowl until thick, about 5
              minutes. Whisk superfine sugar into egg whites until thick,
              glossy, and stiff peaks form, 5 to 8 more minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 3</strong><br />
              Sift almond meal and confectioners' sugar over beaten egg whites;
              gently fold in, retaining as much air as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 4</strong><br />
              Divide meringue into separate bowls to flavor and color, if
              desired.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 5</strong><br />
              Spoon meringue into a piping bag fitted with a 3/8-inch tip. Pipe
              1-inch disks of meringue onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving
              about 2 inches between cookies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 6</strong><br />
              Let cookies stand at room temperature to form a thin skin, about
              15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 7</strong><br />
              Lift the baking sheets; let drop from several inches above the
              work surface to adhere cookies to the baking sheets.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Step 8</strong><br />
              Bake in the preheated oven until tops are dry, about 15 minutes;
              let cool completely on the baking sheets before peeling off the
              parchment paper, about 45 minutes.
